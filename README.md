### Resilia Coding Exercise

#### *Instructions*

  Build a simple app that displays a list of notifications on a web page. The payload of the notification is arbitrary (pick a simple domain based on what you know about our customers) but the attributes that allow it to function as a notification should make sense.

  The purpose of this is to not spend a lot of time building a perfect, scalable and impressive system, but to use the tools you’re comfortable with building a basic solution to the prompt above; one that you can walk me through in detail. We’ll walk through it in person, and expand upon it onsite.

#### *Requirements*

  frontend should request notifications from an API

  notifications should be housed in a persistent store

  persistent store that can survive the API server restarting

  notification objects contain arbitrary domain data along with attributes that allow it to function as a “notification” a user is intended to receive

#### *Assumptions*

  the app’s user - the recipient of the notification - is not the creator/author
